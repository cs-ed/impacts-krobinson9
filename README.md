# Impacts on Society

Enrichment Course: Intro to Computer Science (class meets 2 days a week for 50 minutes)

This course introduces the concepts and language of computer science as well as having the students look at the overarching societal impacts of technology including how to use technology responsibly. Students will learn the binary number system including how to convert from base 10 to base 2 and arithmetic that is necessary for the beginning concepts of computer science. Students will begin designing and writing code, as well as creating a game for their final project. While completing these projects, students will be researching a positive or negative impact technology has had on society and how we can either incorporate it into or mitigate its effects in the computer science classroom as well as creating a presentation for the 5th and 6th graders about using technology responsibly.

Grade Level: 7th and 8th Grade

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to analyze the impacts of a specific piece of technology (social media platform, app, game, etc), determine if there are positive and/or negative impacts to society with supporting evidence, and develop a plan for how we could increase the positive effects or mitigate the negative effects of that technology.

Students will design a presentation (using a platform of their choosing) to anazlye and explain responsible technology use, both at school and privately, for the 5th and 6th graders.

### Learning Activities

The class will be a 12 week long enrichment course so the students will have 2 six week projects to complete . 
The first project will have students completing class and partner discussions to determine responsible technology use for the classroom and for private use (at home). Once students have analyzed and designed a comprehensive list of responsible teachnology use and practices, they will put together a presentation for the 5th and 6th grade classes using a platform of their choosing (powerpoint, google slides, filp deck, animated video, etc). Students can either work independently or with a partner to complete the project.
The students will use the first 2 class meetings to collaborate and complete the comprehensive list, the next 4 class periods will be creating their presentation, the next week will be peer review with the following week allowing class time for revisions, and the final week would be presenting to one of the 5th or 6th grade classes.

The second project will have students analyzing a specific piece of technology that they choose, to determine the positive and/or negative impacts it can have on society. Students will start by choosing their topic and take the first 2 weeks to look at the positive impacts it has/could have on society. Students will then use the next 2 weeks to look at the negative impacts. Students will have a google form to fill out, one for the positive and one for the negative with questions allowing them to record their research, organize their supporting arguements, as well as include their references. At the end of the project, students will create a written report with their findings as well as ideas for keeping impacts positive and mitigating the potential negative impacts.

### Assessment

The presentation will be assessed according to a rubric and a survey that will be given to the 5th and 6th grade students.

The written research report will be presented to peers in the class but also will be graded according to a rubric at the end of the enrichment course.

### Outcomes

The plan helps facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion by allowing students choice in the topics that they research and in the methods of presenting, allowing relevance and interest to be the guiding factors. I also think presenting to the lower grades, the 5th and 6th grade students, will allow us to begin having the conversation of impacts of technology and responsible computing at an even younger age. I think it is important to get students thinking about the responsibility of using technology as soon as we can, and this will enable us to start that conversationg and maybe even have our 7th and 8th graders take ownership of their own technology use.
